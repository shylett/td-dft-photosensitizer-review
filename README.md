# TD-DFT Review: Photosensitizer Modeling for Photodynamic Therapy

This repository contains a structured literature review of 13 studies applying TD-DFT (Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory) to model the electronic behavior of photosensitizers used in photodynamic therapy (PDT).

### Contents:
- `photosensitizer_matrix.csv`: Structured matrix of reviewed studies.
- `analyze_matrix.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for simple analysis and visualizations.
- `workflow_summary.md`: Conceptual workflow for TD-DFT simulation in PDT research.

This is an early-stage research scaffold created as part of a broader effort to develop physics-informed therapeutic discovery platforms.
